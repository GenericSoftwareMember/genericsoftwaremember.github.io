        <h1>The Sun</h1>
        
        <p> The Sun, the nineteenth card in the Major Arcana, radiates joy, success, and enlightenment. 
            It often features a bright sun shining in a clear sky, and a child riding a white horse, 
            symbolizing pure, unbridled optimism.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The Sun appears upright in a reading, it signifies a period of immense joy, success, 
            and positivity. This card represents clarity, abundance, and a sense of achievement. It 
            encourages you to embrace the light of truth and bask in the warmth of happiness. The Sun 
            suggests that you are in a position of power, confidence, and authenticity. It's a reminder 
            to stay true to yourself and to share your light and warmth with others.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The Sun may indicate a temporary blockage of joy or a struggle to see 
            the positive side of a situation. You might be facing challenges or feeling overshadowed by 
            negativity. This card encourages you to overcome any obstacles and remember that the sun will 
            shine again. It may also suggest that you need to rekindle your inner light and optimism. Be 
            patient, and soon the clouds will clear, revealing the bright and hopeful side of life.
