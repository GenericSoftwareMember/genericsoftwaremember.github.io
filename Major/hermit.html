        <h1>The Hermit</h1>
        
        <p> The Hermit, the ninth card in the Major Arcana, represents introspection, solitude, and inner 
            guidance. It often features a cloaked figure holding a lantern, symbolizing the search for 
            inner wisdom.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The Hermit appears upright in a reading, it signifies a period of introspection, solitude, 
            and inner searching. This card represents a time for self-reflection, seeking answers within, and 
            connecting with your inner wisdom. The Hermit encourages you to withdraw from external distractions 
            and noise to find clarity, understanding, and enlightenment. It's a reminder that answers to your 
            questions can be found within, and this introspective journey can lead to profound insights.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The Hermit may indicate a reluctance to seek solitude or a fear of introspection. 
            You might be avoiding self-reflection or resisting the need for inner guidance. This card encourages 
            you to embrace moments of solitude and self-discovery. It may also suggest that you are seeking answers 
            outside of yourself rather than looking within. Reconnect with your inner wisdom, and trust in your ability 
            to find the answers you seek.
        </p>
