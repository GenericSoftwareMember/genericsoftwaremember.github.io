        <h1>The Moon</h1>
        
        <p> The Moon, the eighteenth card in the Major Arcana, symbolizes intuition, illusion, and 
            the subconscious mind. It often features a moonlit landscape with a crayfish emerging 
            from water and two canines howling at the moon.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The Moon appears upright in a reading, it signifies a period of heightened intuition, 
            emotions, and mystery. This card represents the need to trust your instincts and delve 
            deeper into your subconscious. It can suggest hidden truths, psychic experiences, or dream 
            exploration. The Moon encourages you to embrace the unknown and face your fears with 
            courage, knowing that not everything is as it seems. It's a reminder to rely on your inner 
            guidance and let go of illusions.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The Moon may indicate confusion, deception, or a lack of clarity. 
            You might be feeling disoriented or misled by your emotions. This card encourages you to 
            seek clarity and avoid making hasty decisions. It may also suggest that you are not in touch
             with your intuition or are ignoring your inner wisdom. Take time for introspection and inner 
             reflection to uncover hidden truths and navigate through the fog of uncertainty.
        </p>
