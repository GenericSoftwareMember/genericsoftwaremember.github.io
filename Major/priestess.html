        <h1>The Priestess</h1>

        <p> Also known as the High Priestess, the Priestess is the second card that appears in the Tarot deck.
            She embodies mystery, intuition, and the subconscious. It has a great focus on believing in the
            inner wisdom within people.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The High Priestess appears upright in a reading, it indicates a time of deep intuition and 
            heightened awareness. Trust your instincts and tap into your inner wisdom. Secrets and mysteries may 
            be revealed, and you are encouraged to explore your subconscious. This card suggests a need for 
            patience and introspection before taking action. Listen to your inner voice and pay attention to dreams 
            and intuitive insights.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The High Priestess can signal a lack of intuition or a reluctance to acknowledge 
            your inner wisdom. You might be ignoring important insights or resisting your intuitive side. It could 
            also point to hidden agendas or unresolved mysteries. This card urges you to reconnect with your intuition, 
            explore your subconscious, and be open to the unknown. Avoid ignoring your inner guidance, as it may 
            hold the key to understanding your current situation.
