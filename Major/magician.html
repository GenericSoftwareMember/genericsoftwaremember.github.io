        <h1>The Magician</h1>

        <p> The Magician is the first card to appear in the numbered order, it symbolizing mastery, power, 
            and the meeting of the physical and spiritual worlds. Since the Fool can be either at the beginning
            or end of the deck, the Magician usually acts as the first step in the Fool's Journey. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The Magician appears upright in a reading, it signifies that you have the skills, tools, and 
            potential to manifest your desires. It's a time of empowerment and transformation, where your ideas 
            can become reality through focused intent and action. Use your talents wisely and trust in your 
            abilities to create positive change in your life.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The Magician can suggest a lack of focus or misuse of one's talents. It may 
            indicate manipulation, trickery, or the abuse of power. Be cautious of deceptive influences, and 
            assess whether you are using your abilities to benefit yourself and others or for self-serving purposes. 
            This card calls for self-reflection and realignment of your intentions to manifest positive outcomes.
