        <h1>The Tower</h1>
        
        <p> The sixteen card, the Tower, is a peculiar one. The reason being is that its meaning, sudden 
            upheaval, chaos, and revelation, are often negative. This means the Tower is likely the only card
            that has little to no positive interpretations compared to the rest, and is seen as an omen to
            get, even if upright. Due to this, some decks have actually removed the Tower entirely.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The Tower appears upright in a reading, it signifies a profound and unforeseen change 
            or revelation that shakes the foundations of your life. This card represents the need to break 
            free from old structures, beliefs, or situations that no longer serve your growth. While the 
            experience may be unsettling, it is often necessary for personal transformation and rebuilding. 
            The Tower encourages you to embrace change as an opportunity for growth and renewal.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The Tower may indicate a resistance to change or a delayed crisis. You 
            might be avoiding addressing necessary upheaval or clinging to unstable situations. This card 
            advises you to confront issues head-on and not postpone the inevitable. Avoiding change may 
            lead to a more catastrophic event later. Embrace the idea of dismantling what no longer serves 
            you and rebuilding your life with a stronger foundation.
        </p>
