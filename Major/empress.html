        <h1>The Empress</h1>

        <p> The Empress is the third of the Major Arcana, representing the concepts of fertility, nurturing, and abundance.
            It ties heavily into the idea of motherhood, also embodying action and initiative. It also has connections to 
            the planet Venus due to the planet having a similar connotation to femininity.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The Empress appears upright in a reading, it signifies a period of growth, fertility, and creativity. 
            This card heralds abundance and prosperity, whether it's related to material wealth, family, or creative 
            projects. It encourages you to connect with your nurturing side and bring your ideas and projects to fruition. 
            It's a reminder to embrace and appreciate the beauty of the natural world.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The Empress may indicate a blockage or imbalance in the areas of fertility, creativity, 
            or abundance. You might be neglecting self-care or struggling to nurture your ideas and relationships. This card 
            encourages you to assess where you might be stifling your creative energy and find ways to restore balance. It 
            can also warn against overindulgence or extravagance, advising moderation and responsible nurturing.
