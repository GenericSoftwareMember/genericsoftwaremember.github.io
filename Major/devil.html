        <h1>The Devil</h1>
        
        <p> The Devil, the fifteenth card in the Major Arcana, represents temptation, bondage, and 
            materialism. It often depicts a horned figure with chains around the necks of a man and 
            woman, symbolizing their entrapment by their desires. The devil in question, at least in 
            the Rider-Waite deck used for all of these cards, is Baphomet, a demon supposedly worshipped 
            by the Knight Templars during the Crusades. The evidence that the Christian knights did such a
            thing are minimal and mostly came around centuries after.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The Devil appears upright in a reading, it signifies a sense of entrapment, materialism, 
            or unhealthy attachments. This card warns against succumbing to temptation and becoming enslaved 
            by worldly desires. It encourages you to examine your life and identify areas where you may 
            be giving in to unhealthy habits or negative influences. Breaking free from these chains requires 
            self-awareness and the courage to face your inner demons.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The Devil may indicate a release from bondage or a break free from 
            unhealthy attachments. You might be overcoming temptations or letting go of negative influences. 
            This card signifies liberation from oppressive situations and encourages you to regain control 
            over your life. It can also represent a period of self-discovery and healing as you free yourself 
            from what once held you back.
