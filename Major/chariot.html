        <h1>The Chariot</h1>
        
        <p> The Chariot, the seventh card in the Major Arcana, represents determination, control, and triumph 
            over challenges. Although the titular chariot is always present, the animals pulling it change between 
            designs. It is sometimes shown as sphinxes, horses, or other animals, typically with a black-and-white 
            motif. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The Chariot appears upright in a reading, it signifies a period of victory, self-discipline, 
            and control over conflicting forces. This card represents your ability to harness your inner 
            strength and drive to overcome obstacles and achieve your goals. It encourages you to stay focused 
            and determined, no matter the challenges you face. The Chariot suggests that you're on a path of 
            accomplishment and personal growth, symbolizing a victorious journey ahead.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The Chariot may indicate a lack of direction or inner turmoil. You might be 
            feeling overwhelmed or struggling to control conflicting aspects of your life. This card encourages 
            you to regain focus and address any inner conflicts before proceeding. It can also signify delays 
            or setbacks in your journey. Take time to reevaluate your goals and regain control over your path, 
            ensuring that you're aligned with your true desires and values.
