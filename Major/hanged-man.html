        <h1>The Hanged Man</h1>
        
        <p> Bearing a gruesome name, the Hanged Man is the twelfth card in the Major Arcana. It embodies 
            surrender, sacrifice, and a shift in perspective. The reason why the man is hanging is actually 
            a reference to Norse mythology, which has the god Odin suspending himself from a tree after 
            sacrificing his eye in order to obtain knowledge.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The Hanged Man appears upright in a reading, it signifies a need to let go, pause, and 
            gain a new perspective on a situation. This card represents a willingness to surrender, 
            release control, and view matters from a different angle. It can suggest a period of waiting 
            or self-sacrifice for a greater purpose. The Hanged Man encourages you to embrace the wisdom 
            of surrender and find a deeper understanding through introspection.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The Hanged Man may indicate resistance to change, delays, or feeling 
            stuck. You might be reluctant to let go of old beliefs or habits, hindering your progress. 
            This card advises you to release resistance and be open to new perspectives and experiences. 
            It can also signify impatience or a need to take action. Embrace change willingly and trust 
            that a shift in perspective will bring clarity and growth.
