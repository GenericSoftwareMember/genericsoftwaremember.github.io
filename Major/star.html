        <h1>The Star</h1>
        
        <p> The Star, the seventeenth card in the Major Arcana, symbolizes hope, inspiration, and 
            spiritual guidance. It often features a woman kneeling beside a pool of water, pouring 
            water from two jugs into a pond and gazing at a star-filled sky.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The Star appears upright in a reading, it signifies a time of inspiration, hope, and 
            healing. This card represents a renewed sense of purpose and a connection to higher guidance. 
            It encourages you to have faith in the future and follow your dreams. The Star suggests that 
            even in challenging times, there is a guiding light that can lead you toward greater 
            fulfillment and happiness. Trust in your own intuition and the universe's plan for you.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The Star may indicate a lack of hope, doubt, or disconnection from your 
            inner guidance. You might be feeling lost or struggling to find inspiration. This card encourages 
            you to reconnect with your dreams and aspirations. It may also suggest that you need to address 
            any feelings of hopelessness or negativity. Remember that even in difficult times, there is 
            still a spark of hope and inspiration within you.
