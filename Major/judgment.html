        <h1>The Judgment</h1>
        
        <p> Judgment, the twentieth card in the Major Arcana, represents rebirth, self-reflection, 
            and spiritual awakening. It often features figures rising from coffins, symbolizing a 
            call to a higher purpose. In the Thoth deck, it is replaced by the Aeon.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When Judgment appears upright in a reading, it signifies a period of self-reflection, 
            renewal, and transformation. This card represents a call to awaken to your true self and 
            embrace a higher purpose. It encourages you to let go of past mistakes, judgments, and 
            regrets and to make amends or seek forgiveness if necessary. Judgment marks a moment of 
            personal growth and a fresh start. It's a reminder to listen to your inner calling and 
            live in alignment with your values and beliefs.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, Judgment may indicate a reluctance to change, a fear of judgment, 
            or resistance to self-reflection. You might be avoiding facing the consequences of your 
            actions or neglecting your inner calling. This card encourages you to confront your past and 
            make necessary changes for personal growth. It may also warn against procrastination or 
            avoiding important decisions. Embrace the opportunity for transformation and self-awareness 
            that Judgment offers, even if it feels uncomfortable.
