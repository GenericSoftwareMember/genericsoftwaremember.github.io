        <h1>The Temperance</h1>
        
        <p> Temperance, the fourteenth card in the Major Arcana, embodies balance, harmony, and moderation. 
            It often features an angelic figure pouring liquid between two cups, symbolizing the 
            blending of opposites.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When Temperance appears upright in a reading, it signifies a need for balance, patience, and 
            moderation in your life. This card represents harmony and the ability to blend conflicting 
            elements. It encourages you to find middle ground and approach situations with a calm and balanced 
            demeanor. Temperance suggests that by avoiding extremes and embracing compromise, you can 
            achieve inner and outer harmony.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, Temperance may indicate a lack of balance, impatience, or excessive behavior. 
            You might be struggling to find equilibrium in your life or be prone to impulsiveness. This card 
            encourages you to reevaluate your actions and find ways to bring balance back into your life. 
            It may also warn against overindulgence or hasty decisions. Take time to reflect and restore 
            equilibrium in your thoughts, emotions, and actions.
        </p>
