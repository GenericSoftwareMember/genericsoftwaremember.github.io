        <h1>The Death</h1>
        
        <p> Contrary to what one would assume from its name, Death in tarot is not actually a purely negative
            card. The thirteenth card is associated with major upheavals, transformation, renewal, and well, death.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When Death appears upright in a reading, it signifies a profound transformation or change that 
            is inevitable and necessary for growth. This card represents the end of one phase of life, 
            making way for a new and improved one. It encourages you to embrace the process of letting go, 
            shedding old beliefs, and releasing attachments. While it can be unsettling, Death heralds a 
            positive transformation, much like the changing seasons.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, Death may indicate resistance to change or a fear of letting go. You might 
            be holding onto the past or avoiding necessary endings. This card urges you to confront these 
            fears and embrace change willingly. It can also suggest a stagnant situation that requires a 
            shake-up to move forward. Avoiding change may lead to stagnation, so be open to the 
            transformational process.
        </p>
