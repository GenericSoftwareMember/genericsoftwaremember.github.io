        <h1>The World</h1>
        
        <p> Unless the Fool is considered the twenty-second, The World is the twenty-first and final card in the 
            Major Arcana. It symbolizes completion, fulfillment, and unity. In Thoth's deck, it is instead called 
            the Universe.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The World appears upright in a reading, it signifies a sense of accomplishment, fulfillment, 
            and unity with the universe. This card represents the successful completion of a significant 
            life cycle or goal. It encourages you to celebrate your achievements, embrace new opportunities, 
            and recognize your place in the grand scheme of life. The World is a reminder that you are in 
            harmony with your surroundings and that the possibilities are endless.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The World may indicate a sense of incompleteness, stagnation, or feeling 
            disconnected from your purpose. You might be struggling to achieve closure or find your place 
            in the world. This card encourages you to reflect on what might be holding you back and what you 
            need to do to move forward. It may also suggest that you are not fully embracing your potential 
            or that you need to overcome obstacles to reach your goals. Embrace the opportunity to find closure, 
            make necessary changes, and realign with your life's purpose.
