        <h1>The Strength</h1>
        
        <p> As stated before, the exact positioning of the Strength and Justice can be interchanged between 
            decks, so their placement can be confusing. For this, the Strength shall be the eleventh card in 
            the major Arcana, which symbolizes courage, inner strength, and compassion.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When Strength appears upright in a reading, it signifies inner courage, resilience, and the 
            ability to overcome challenges through inner strength. This card represents the power of 
            patience, compassion, and self-control. It encourages you to approach difficult situations 
            with grace and kindness, rather than force or aggression. Strength reminds you that you have 
            the inner fortitude to face adversity and emerge victorious.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, Strength may indicate a lack of inner strength or a struggle to control 
            impulses. You might be feeling overwhelmed by circumstances or have difficulty finding patience 
            and compassion. This card encourages you to focus on self-discipline and building inner resilience. 
            It can also serve as a warning against confrontations or using force to address problems. 
            Take time to nurture your inner strength and practice patience and kindness, even in 
            challenging moments.
