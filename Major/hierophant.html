        <h1>The Hierophant</h1>
        
        <p> The Hierophant, the fifth card in the Major Arcana, symbolizes tradition, spirituality, and 
            guidance. The card actually has numerous different names depending on the set. It is sometimes 
            called the Pope or the High Priest.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The Hierophant appears upright in a reading, it signifies a time of seeking guidance from 
            established traditions or spiritual sources. It represents a need for structure, faith, and 
            conformity to societal norms. This card encourages you to turn to mentors, teachers, or 
            spiritual advisors for wisdom and support. It suggests a commitment to a spiritual or moral 
            path and can indicate important ceremonies or rites.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The Hierophant may suggest a resistance to tradition or a desire to break 
            free from societal or religious norms. You might be questioning established beliefs and seeking a 
            more individualistic path. This card encourages you to explore your spirituality and ethics 
            independently, but also warns against rebelling without thoughtful consideration. It could also 
            indicate a need to find unconventional sources of guidance or a period of uncertainty regarding 
            your beliefs.
