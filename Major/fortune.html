        <h1>The Fortune</h1>
        
        <p> The Fortune, its full name actually being the Wheel of Fortune, symbolizes cycles, destiny, and 
            change. It often features a large wheel with different creatures or figures representing the 
            ever-turning wheel of fate. Notably, on this design of the Rider-Waite deck, it actually has one 
            of the names associated with the Biblical God spelled out in Hebrew, YHWH.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Upright</h2>
        <p> When The Wheel of Fortune appears upright in a reading, it signifies a positive turn of events, 
            luck, and the cyclical nature of life. This card represents a period of change, often for the 
            better. It encourages you to embrace the ups and downs of life, knowing that everything moves 
            in cycles. This is a reminder that good fortune and opportunities can unexpectedly come your 
            way. Be open to change and go with the flow, as the wheel of life continues to turn.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reversed</h2>
        <p> In a reversed position, The Wheel of Fortune may indicate a temporary setback, delays, or missed 
            opportunities. You might feel like you're stuck in a negative cycle or facing obstacles. This card 
            encourages you to exercise caution, especially in financial matters, and prepare for potential 
            challenges. It also reminds you that, even in difficult times, the wheel will eventually turn in 
            your favor. Focus on maintaining a positive outlook and adapt to changes as they come.
